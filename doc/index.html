<h1>The Package Forge Registry</h1>

<p>The Package Forge registry is designed to facilitate the scheduling
and tracking of build jobs once they have been submitted. It does not
necessarily contain everything which defines a job (e.g. the list of
packages or instructions for the specific build daemons).</p>

<p>Once a newly submitted <em>job</em> has been processed and accepted
a set of associated <em>tasks</em> are registered, one per target
platform and architecture. As well as the registry of jobs and tasks,
the registry stores information on the supported platforms and the
build daemons for those platforms. When a build daemon needs to find a
new task or update the status of a task it talks directly to the
database. For simplicity and safety, the database layer handles all
the necessary locking, transactions and consistency checks, there is
no middle layer of extra code.</p>

<h2>The Schema</h2>

<p>The full details of the <a href="pkgforge.html">database schema</a>
are available or you can view a <a href="pkgforge.png">relationship
diagram</a> generated using
<a href="http://www.rbt.ca/autodoc/">postgresql_autodoc</a> and
GraphViz.</p>

<h2>Platforms</h2>

<p>
  In the Package Forge Registry a <em>platform</em> is a build target
  which is uniquely identified by the combination of the <em>name</em>
  and the <em>architecture</em>, for example <code>f13/i386</code>
  or <code>sl5/x86_64</code>.
</p>

<p>
  For new tasks to be registered for a platform it must be marked
  as <em>active</em>. To maintain referential integrity, a platform
  should <strong>never</strong> be removed once tasks have been
  registered. If a platform is no longer supported it should be marked
  as <em>inactive</em> (i.e. <em>active</em>) is false.
</p>

<p>
  As well as the concept of a platform being <em>active</em> there is
  a secondary attribute (named <em>auto</em>) which controls whether
  or not tasks are registered for this platform by default. If a
  platform is in the default set then tasks will be registered unless
  a user has specifically requested that it should be ignored. If
  the <em>auto</em> attribute is set to false (which is the default)
  then a user must either specifically request that platform name or
  must use the <em>all</em> string to show that tasks should be
  registered for every active platform.
</p>


<h2>Builders</h2>

<p>
  In the Package Forge Registry a uniquely named <em>builder</em>
  entry should exist for each build daemon. Typically, it is expected
  that there will be one builder per platform but there are no
  limits. It may well be that there is a period during which there are
  no builders and new tasks will just be queued as long as the
  platform is active. It is also possible to register extra builders
  for a platform which can be used during busy times. Note that having
  a builder registered does not necessarily mean it will take new
  jobs. The builder has to have the necessary permissions to be able
  to talk to the registry database and request new jobs, that must be
  managed separately (normally via the LCFG postgresql component).
</p>

<p>
  When a builder takes on a new task the ID is stored into
  the <em>current</em> field and an entry is added into the <em>build
  log</em>. Note that in some circumstances a builder is allowed to
  give up on a job halfway through without considering this to be a
  failure. This means that a task can appear in the build log multiple
  times for the same or different build daemons (as long as they all
  support the same platform).
</p>

<h2>Build Jobs</h2>

<p>
  When a new job is accepted from the incoming queue it is added to
  the Package Forge Registry along with a subset of the parameters
  specified in the submission. As it goes through the job life-cycle
  the <em>status</em> changes to reflect the stage reached. Whenever
  any aspect of the job changes the <em>modification time</em> is
  automatically updated.
</p>

<p>The sequence of allowed job statuses is:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>incoming</dt>
  <dd>The job is in the incoming queue and currently being processed.</dd>
  <dt>valid</dt>
  <dd>The job is in the incoming queue and has been validated.</dd>
  <dt>invalid</dt>
  <dd>The job is in the incoming queue and is invalid.</dd>
  <dt>accepted</dt>
  <dd>The job has been validated and accepted.</dd>
  <dt>registered</dt>
  <dd>The job has been validated and the associated tasks have been registered.</dd>
  <dt>partial fail</dt>
  <dd>At least one associated task has failed to build.</dd>
  <dt>fail</dt>
  <dd>All associated tasks have failed.</dd>
  <dt>partial success</dt>
  <dd>At least one task has succeeded and none have failed.</dd>
  <dt>success</dt>
  <dd>All tasks have succeeded.</dd>
  <dt>cancelled</dt>
  <dd>All tasks were cancelled.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  In normal circumstances, the first few stages
  - <em>incoming</em>, <em>valid</em>, <em>accepted</em>
  and <em>registered</em> fly by very quickly. The rest can take a
  while and depend on the availability of the various builders for
  each platform.
</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<p>
  When a newly submitted job has been processed and validated a set of
  tasks will then be registered, one for each required platform and
  architecture. Note that tasks are only registered
  for <em>active</em> platforms. Typically, a job will be submitted
  for all platforms and architectures in which case a task will be
  registered for every target platform in the default set. It is
  possible to restrict the set of build platforms by either name or
  architecture. Beware that if you submit a job for non-existent or
  inactive platforms they will just be ignored during the task
  scheduling stage.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the parent job a task has a much more straightforward set of
statuses.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>needs build</dt>
  <dd>The task requires building (default on registration).</dd>
  <dt>building</dt>
  <dd>The task is currently building.</dd>
  <dt>fail</dt>
  <dd>The task has failed to build.</dd>
  <dt>success</dt>
  <dd>The task has been successfully built (and submitted).</dd>
  <dt>cancelled</dt>
  <dd>The task has been cancelled.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  Whenever a task status is updated the parent job status is
  automatically updated within the database. All tasks failed leads
  to a job <em>fail</em> status, any task failure leads to <em>partial
  fail</em>. If all tasks succeed then the job status
  is <em>success</em>, if any succeeds and none has failed then the
  job status is <em>partial success</em>. If all tasks are cancelled
  then the job status is set to <em>cancelled</em>.
