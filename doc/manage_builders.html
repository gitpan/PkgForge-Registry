<h1>PkgForge Admin - Builders</h1>

<p>A platform can have multiple package builders, this is particularly
useful for handling periods of heavy load (e.g. when porting to a new
platform). Adding and removing builders is very simple and can be done
as long as the platform exists. For all the following operations you
will need to have access to the Registry DB as
the <em>pkgforge_admin</em> user.</p>

<h2>The builder admin tool</h2>

<p>All package builder administration is done using
the <em>builder</em> command of the <code>pkgforge</code> tool. This
will be available on any machine which has the PkgForge-Registry
software package installed, that includes the pkgforge master, website
and all package builders.</p>

<p>If you need to know the list of available commands you can type:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge
</pre>

<p>and you will get a list like this:</pre>

<pre>
Available commands:

    commands: list the application's commands
        help: display a command's help screen

      buildd: Build the next job in the queue
     buildd2: Build the next job in the queue
     builder: Manage builder entries in the registry
    incoming: Process the incoming package queue
  initserver: Initialise the Package Forge server environment
    platform: Manage platform entries in the registry
      submit: Submit a set of source packages for building

</pre>

<p>Further to this you can get help for a command like this:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge help builder
</pre>

<p>Which will give the list of supported command-line options. For
example:</p>

<pre>
pkgforge builder [-?] [long options...]

	--configfile        Configuration file
	--name              Builder name
	-? --usage --help   Prints this usage information.
	--platform          Builder platform name
	--architecture      Builder platform architecture
</pre>

<p>If you want to know the list of available sub-commands just enter
the command without anything else, for example:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge builder
</pre>

<p>This gives the following output:</p>

<pre>
You must specify an action from: add, delete, list
</pre>

<p>Not all sub-commands will require all command-line options. You
will be prompted if anything which is required has not been
specified.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>By default the configuration for the Registry DB access is found in
the <code>/etc/pkgforge/registry.yml</code> file. This can be changed
using the <code>--configfile</code> command-line option. The contents
of that file can be managed using the LCFG pkgforge
component. Normally the contents should look something like:</p>

<pre>
--- 
"host": 'pkgforge'
"name": 'pkgforge'
"user": 'pkgforge_admin'
</pre>

<p>For admin access to the PkgForge database you will need to
configure the PostgreSQL <code>pg_ident.conf</code>
and <code>pg_hba.conf</code> files to allow access to
the <em>pkgforge_admin</em> user. This can be done in the LCFG profile
for the host which holds the PkgForge Registry DB using the LCFG
postgresql component like this:</p>

<pre>
!postgresql.ident               mADD(pkgf1)
postgresql.idmap_pkgf1          pkgforge
postgresql.sysname_pkgf1        user1
postgresql.pgname_pkgf1         pkgforge_admin

!postgresql.hostssl             mADD(pkgf1)
postgresql.ssldatabase_pkgf1    pkgforge
postgresql.ssluser_pkgf1        pkgforge_admin
!postgresql.ssladdress_pkgf1    mHOSTIP(host1.example.org)
postgresql.sslnetmask_pkgf1     255.255.255.255
postgresql.sslauthtype_pkgf1    krb5
!postgresql.sslauthopt_pkgf1    mSET(map=<%postgresql.idmap_pkgf1%>)
</pre>

<p>Where <code>user1</code> is your system username
and <code>host1.example.org</code> is your host name. This example
users Kerberos authentication but a similar setup could be done using
password authentication.</p>

<h2>List Current Builders</h2>

<p>To list all the currently registered package builders use the
following command:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge builder list
</pre>

<p>This will return a list which looks something like:</p>

<pre>
Builder		Platform	Architecture
=============================================
bigfan_f13	f13		i386
bigfan_f1364	f13		x86_64
bressler_sl6	sl6		i386
bressler_sl664	sl6		x86_64
circle_sl564	sl5		x86_64
elman_sl5	sl5		i386
elman_sl564	sl5		x86_64
gates_f13	f13		i386
gates_f1364	f13		x86_64
prague_sl5	sl5		i386
</pre>

<p>This is just the list of registered builders. It is possible that
some of the builders are no longer active.</p>

<h2>Adding new Builders</h2>

<p>Adding a new package builder for a platform is very
straightforward. The name of the platform and the architecture for
which you intend to build packages are required. A new unique name for
the builder is also required, normally this is based on the name of
the machine and the name of the platform (e.g. <code>bigfan_f13</code>
or <code>bressler_sl664</code>).</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge builder add --name bigfan_f13 --platform f13 --arch i386
</pre>

<p>Note that if a platform is not marked as <em>active</em> then new
jobs will never be registered and the builder will not actually do
anything.</p>

<p>Once a builder is added to the Registry database then ACLs must be
added to the PostgreSQL configuration. Information on how to do this
is given in the <a href="admin.html">registry admin pages.</p>

<h2>Removing Builders</h2>

<p>It is not necessary to ever remove builders from the database but
it may be desirable for tidiness reasons. It is done like this:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge builder delete --name prague_sl5
</pre>

</body>
