<h1>PkgForge Admin - Platforms</h1>

<p>For all the following operations you will need to have access to
the Registry DB as the <em>pkgforge_admin</em> user.</p>

<h2>The platform admin tool</h2>

<p>All platform administration is done using the <em>platform</em>
command of the <code>pkgforge</code> tool. This will be available on
any machine which has the PkgForge-Registry software package
installed, that includes the pkgforge master, website and all package
builders.</p>

<p>If you need to know the list of available commands you can type:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge
</pre>

<p>and you will get a list like this:</pre>

<pre>
Available commands:

    commands: list the application's commands
        help: display a command's help screen

      buildd: Build the next job in the queue
     buildd2: Build the next job in the queue
     builder: Manage builder entries in the registry
    incoming: Process the incoming package queue
  initserver: Initialise the Package Forge server environment
    platform: Manage platform entries in the registry
      submit: Submit a set of source packages for building

</pre>

<p>Further to this you can get help for a command like this:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge help platform
</pre>

<p>Which will give the list of supported command-line options. For
example:</p>

<pre>
pkgforge platform [-?] [long options...]

	--configfile        Configuration file
	--name              Platform name
	-? --usage --help   Prints this usage information.
	--architecture      Platform architecture
</pre>

<p>If you want to know the list of available sub-commands just enter
the command without anything else, for example:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge platform
</pre>

<p>This gives the following output:</p>

<pre>
You must specify an action from: activate, add, deactivate, list, setauto
</pre>

<p>Not all sub-commands will require all command-line options. You
will be prompted if anything which is required has not been
specified.</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>By default the configuration for the Registry DB access is found in
the <code>/etc/pkgforge/registry.yml</code> file. This can be changed
using the <code>--configfile</code> command-line option. The contents
of that file can be managed using the LCFG pkgforge
component. Normally the contents should look something like:</p>

<pre>
--- 
"host": 'pkgforge'
"name": 'pkgforge'
"user": 'pkgforge_admin'
</pre>

<p>For admin access to the PkgForge database you will need to
configure the PostgreSQL <code>pg_ident.conf</code>
and <code>pg_hba.conf</code> files to allow access to
the <em>pkgforge_admin</em> user. This can be done in the LCFG profile
for the host which holds the PkgForge Registry DB using the LCFG
postgresql component like this:</p>

<pre>
!postgresql.ident               mADD(pkgf1)
postgresql.idmap_pkgf1          pkgforge
postgresql.sysname_pkgf1        user1
postgresql.pgname_pkgf1         pkgforge_admin

!postgresql.hostssl             mADD(pkgf1)
postgresql.ssldatabase_pkgf1    pkgforge
postgresql.ssluser_pkgf1        pkgforge_admin
!postgresql.ssladdress_pkgf1    mHOSTIP(host1.example.org)
postgresql.sslnetmask_pkgf1     255.255.255.255
postgresql.sslauthtype_pkgf1    krb5
!postgresql.sslauthopt_pkgf1    mSET(map=<%postgresql.idmap_pkgf1%>)
</pre>

<p>Where <code>user1</code> is your system username
and <code>host1.example.org</code> is your host name. This example
users Kerberos authentication but a similar setup could be done using
password authentication.</p>

<h2>List Platforms</h2>

<p>To list all the known platforms use the following command:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge platform list
</pre>

<p>This will return a list which looks something like:</p>

<pre>
Name	Architecture	Active	Auto
=====================================
f13	i386		1	1
f13	x86_64		1	1
sl5	i386		1	1
sl5	x86_64		1	1
sl6	i386		1	0
sl6	x86_64		1	0
</pre>

<p>If a platform is not marked as <em>active</em> then it is not
possible to register new jobs. If it is marked as <em>active</em> but
not <em>auto</em> then new jobs will be registered only when
specifically requested, that platform will not be in the default
set.</p>

<h2>Adding a new Platform</h2>

<p>Adding a platform is very straightforward. The name of the platform
and the architecture for which you intend to build packages are
required, e.g. <code>f13</code> and <code>i386</code>. Unlike with
LCFG the name of the platform is the same on all architectures. For
example:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge platform add --name f13 --arch i386
</pre>

<p>Once a platform is added you will need to make it active and add
builders.</p>

<h2>Activating a Platform</h2>

<p>If a platform is not marked as <em>active</em> then it will not be
possible to register new build jobs. A new platform starts in the
inactive state, once a platform is no longer supported it should be
returned to the inactive state.</p>

<p>To activate a platform do something like the following example:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge platform activate --name f13 --arch i386
</pre>

<h2>Deactivating a Platform</h2>

<p>If a platform is not marked as <em>active</em> then it will not be
possible to register new build jobs. A new platform starts in the
inactive state, once a platform is no longer supported it should be
returned to the inactive state. Once jobs have been registered for a
platform then to maintain referential integrity it is not possible to
remove a platform from the DB, instead old platforms are just marked
as inactive.</p>

<p>To deactivate a platform do something like the following example:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge platform deactivate --name f13 --arch i386
</pre>

<h2>Set a Platform to Automatic</h2>

<p>Once a platform is marked as <em>active</em> it is possible to add
new jobs by explicitly requesting the platform name or by using
the <em>all</em> set of platforms. If a platform should be
automatically included in the default set of platforms (i.e. when a
user does not make a specific platform request then jobs will be
registered for the platform) then it must be marked
as <em>auto</em>. This is done like the following example:</p>

<pre>
% pkgforge platform setauto --name f13 --arch i386
</pre>

<h2>Deleting a Platform</h2>

<p>Once jobs have been registered for a platform then to maintain
referential integrity it is not possible to remove a platform from the
DB, instead old platforms should just be marked as inactive.</p>
